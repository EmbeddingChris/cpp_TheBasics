# cpp_TheBasics

This is the accompanying repository to my article series [c++: the basics](https://embeddingchris.com/category/the-road/primary-programming-language/c/).
If you follow my blog [embeddingchris.com](embeddingchris.com) and the post series, you can easily find the explained examples here.

## Getting Started

Just clone the repository and open the file with the editor / IDE of your choice.

- run the code
- look at the code
- play with the code

That's the was to work with these examples.

And please feel free to make comments, improvements and questions.
